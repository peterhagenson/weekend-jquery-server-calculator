Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The assignments asked for me to create a calculator in which a user would enter numbers into two inputs and select an operator (+, -, \*, /), package that info into an object, send it to the server, run it through a function that completes the calculation, and then present the result of the calculation on the DOM, along with a history of all calculations that the user has made.

-input fields attached to = button

- click listener attached to container # of the operator container
  - find closest button, pull the text from the symbol on the button, assign it to a variable that gets packaged in an object along with the values entered into the two input fields, and send it to the server via ajax

Installation
How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example -- Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the .env file.

Create a database named your database name,
The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
